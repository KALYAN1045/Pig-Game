# Pig Game üê∑

- The Pig Game, also known as Pass the Pigs, is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a single die.
- Each player accumulates points based on the outcome of each roll. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in that round and their turn ends.
- To avoid losing points, players have the option to "hold," which adds their current round's points to their total score and passes the turn to the next player.
- The first player to reach a predetermined score threshold (typically 100 points) wins the game.
